    <h2 class="mb-24">Things I do</h2>
    <p>In case you're curious about the things I know how do, here are some things I have experience with:</p>
    <h4 class="mb-12">Transportation, geography, and urban planning</h4>
    <p>I plan transportation networks, particularly transit networks. I create maps and graphics for various projects, and work in GIS software like QGIS, ArcGIS and Felt Maps. I analyze transit and demographic data in R, handle Big Data and crowdsourced datasets like Replica and GO data from Transit, and review and interpret survey data and open survey responses.</p>
    <p>I also design brochures and schedules for transit agencies and work with the GTFS-Static data standard, making manual changes to enhance trip planners.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-12">Sysadmin and networking</h4>
    <p>I manage home and small business networks, including WiFi, network segmentation, and security. I handle macOS management, which involves working in Apple Business Manager, deploying MDM, setting up configuration profiles, and automating program installation and updates. </p>
    <p>Additionally, I administer and secure my own Google Workspace account, and I have experience in managing endpoint security platforms, Secure Web Gateways (SWGs), and deploying Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) connectors.</p>
    <h4 class="mb-12">Web and general development</h4>
    <p>As part of the macOS work, I've written some scripts to help with capturing important information, configuring computers for new users, and informing users about updates and security.</p>
    <p>I'm also learning how to code websites, use static site generators, and deploy static websites (like this one!)</p>

    <h2 class="mb-24">Outside of work</h2>
    <p>When I'm not working, I'm still passionate about transportation and cities - I love to ride transit and explore new places in my city.</p>
    <p>I've been playing for my local inclusive rugby team for about a year and a half - so I guess you could say I'm also a rugger-in-progress.</p>
