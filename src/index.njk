<h1 class="mb-24">Hello!</h1>
<p>Hey there! My name is Jason Adle. I'm a transit planner, urbanist, technology nerd, developer-in-progress, and sysadmin-in-progress.</p>
<p>My goal is to be "an innovator in motion" - that is, always improving, always moving, and always in the service of doing things right.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out through any other methods on the <a href=https://landing.jasonadle.com>landing page.</a></p>

<h2 class="mb-24">About this website</h2>
<p>If you've been to my website before, you may have noticed that this looks a lot different than the previous one.</p>
<p>I've decided to do a bigger redesign but in the meantime, this site is meant to provide some information and a nice landing spot whilst I work on the redesign.</p>
<p>It's also meant to be a place for me to try my hand at static sites!</p>
