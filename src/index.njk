<h2 class="mb-24">About this website</h2>
<p>If you've been to my website before, you may have noticed that this looks a lot different than the previous one.</p>
<p>I've decided to do a bigger redesign but in the meantime, this site is meant to provide some information and a nice landing spot whilst I work on the redesign.</p>
<p>It's also meant to be a place for me to try my hand at static sites!</p>
