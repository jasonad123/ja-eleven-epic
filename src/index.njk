<p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.</p>
<p>The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</p>
<p>It's true, it's true!</p>
<p>And the other thing is, my sister had a baby and I took it over after she passed away and the baby lost all its legs and arms and now its just a stump but I take care of it with my wife and...</p>
<p> and its' growing and it's fairly happy... and its difficult because I'm working a second shift at the factory to put food on the table but all the love that I see in that little guy's face it makes it worth it in the end. True story.</p>
