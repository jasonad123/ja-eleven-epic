    <p>I take the security of my systems and data seriously. If you discover a security issue, I appreciate your assistance in responsibly disclosing it to me.</p>
    <p class="ml-24"><b>Report the issue: </b> Please report any security vulnerabilities you discover by reaching out to me at the email in security.txt. Include detailed information about the issue, including steps to reproduce it.</p>
    <p class="ml-24"><b>Don't disclose publicly: </b> To protect users, I request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until I have had an opportunity to address it.</p>
    <p class="ml-24"><b>Provide details: </b> Help me by providing as much information as possible about the vulnerability. This may include code snippets, screenshots, and any other relevant details.</p>
    <p class="ml-24"><b>No disruptions: </b>Please do not engage in activities that could disrupt services or compromise user data. Use only the necessary steps to demonstrate the vulnerability.</p>
    <p class="ml-24"><b>My response: </b>I will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide updates as I work to address the issue. I may contact you for further information or clarification.</p>
    <p class="ml-24"><b>Recognition:</b> If you are the first to report a valid security issue and do not disclose it publicly before I address it, I will acknowledge your contribution in the repos. I wish I could do a bug bounty but I'm not that well-off.</p>
    <p>Thank you for helping keep my systems and data safe!</p>
